It's all about [Separation of Concerns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_concerns).

### Models:
- Represent your data in your code
- Work with your data (e.g. save, fetch)

### Views: 
- What the users see
- Decoupled from your application code

### Controllers (connected with Routes):
- Connecting your Models and your Views
- Contains the "in-between" logic
- Kind of split across Middleware Functions
